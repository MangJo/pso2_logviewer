# pso2_logviewer
Text Log Viewer App for pso2's logs. Useful only if you have over 1,000 text files of the game's log,
or if you want to backread chats, read nostalgic moments from chats, search blackmail materials
or whatever.

Originally, I made this app because there's a particular chat I want to find but I got alot of logfiles
worth of 2 years so...

The LogViewer only reads chat logs. I planned to add other kinds of logs before but I decided not to
because I think the other logs seem to be useless unless you are the kind of person auditing almost
any kind of expenses like AC, FUN points etc.

The features of this app are simple:
-Colored text according to the chat type.
-You can choose what to display i.e. date, playername, playerID etc.
-Simple search both text list files and log contents.
-You can select a different folder where the logs are stored.
